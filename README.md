# UNH_Schedule_Surfer

This program is a Windows application that allows the user to easily browse through the UNH Durham campus buildings, classes, and professors.
By default the Fall 2021 Semester is loaded into the program, but allows the user to drop a new spreadsheet in, when they're released to staff.
Very helpful with dealing with TD Tickets as you can copy the retrieved data to your clipboard with a single click.
